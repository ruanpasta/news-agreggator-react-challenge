# Ruan Pasta - News Agreggator React Challenge


## Running with node

Install the dependencies with:
`npm install`

And run the project with:
`npm run dev`

## Running with Docker

Run this project using Docker the command:
`docker compose up --build`

With that, you'll have the Hot Reload, and your changes will be mirrored in the container.

But, if you need to install a new lib, it's a good idea to rebuild the container.
